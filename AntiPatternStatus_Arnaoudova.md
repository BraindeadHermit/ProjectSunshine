| A.1 | Get more than accessor                       | A getter that performs actions other than returning the corresponding attribute.                                                                                                                                                                      | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | get_more_than_accessor.py           |
| A.2 | Is returns more than a Boolean               | The name of a method is a predicate suggesting a true/false value in return. However the return type is not Boolean but rather a more complex type.                                                                                                   | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | is_no_return_bool.py                |
| A.3 | Set method returns                           | A set method having a return type different than void.                                                                                                                                                                                                | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | set_returns.py                      |
| A.4 | Expecting but not getting single instance    | The name of a method indicates that a single object is returned but the return type is a collection.                                                                                                                                                  | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | expecting_not_getting_single.py     |
| B.1 | Not implemented condition                    | The comments of a method suggest a conditional behavior that is not implemented in the code. When the implementation is default this should be documented                                                                                             | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | not_implemented_condition.py        |
| B.2 | Validation method does not confirm           | A validation method (e.g., name starting with validate, check, ensure) does not confirm the validation, i.e., the method neither provides a return value informing whether the validation was successful, nor documents how to proceed to understand. | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | validate_not_confirm.py             |
| B.3 | Get method does not return                   | The name suggests that the method returns something (e.g., name starts with get or return) but the return type is void.                                                                                                                               | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | get_no_return.py                    |
| B.4 | Not answered question                        | The name of a method is in the form of predicate whereas the return type is not Boolean.                                                                                                                                                              | <mark>!!! Implemented !!!</mark> | not_answered_question.py            |
| B.5 | Transform method does not return             | The name of a method suggests the transformation of an object but there is no return value and it is not clear from the documentation where the result is stored.                                                                                     | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | transform_not_return.py             |
| B.6 | Expecting but not getting a collection       | The name of a method suggests that a collection should be returned but a single object or nothing is returned.                                                                                                                                        | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | expecting_not_getting_collection.py |
| C.1 | Method name and return type are opposite     | The documentation of a method is in contradiction with its declaration.                                                                                                                                                                               | Not Started                      |                                     |
| C.2 | Method signature and comment are opposite    | The name of an attribute suggests a single instance, while its type suggests that the attribute stores a collection of objects.                                                                                                                       | Not Started                      |                                     |
| D.1 | Says one but contains many                   | The name of an attribute suggests a single instance, while its type suggests that the attribute stores a collection of objects.                                                                                                                       | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | says_one_contains_many.py           |
| D.2 | Name suggests boolean but type is not        | The name of an attribute suggests that its value is true or false, but its declaring type is not Boolean.                                                                                                                                             | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | name_suggest_boolean_type_not.py    |
| E.1 | Says many but contains one                   | The name of an attribute suggests multiple instances, but its type suggests a single one.                                                                                                                                                             | <mark>Implemented</mark>         | says_many_contains_one.py           |
| F.1 | Attribute name and type are opposite         | The name of an attribute is in contradiction with its type as they contain antonyms.                                                                                                                                                                  | Not Started                      |                                     |
| F.2 | Attribute signature and comment are opposite | The declaration of an attribute is in contradiction with its documentation.                                                                                                                                                                           | Not Started                      |                                     |
